        &emsp;&emsp;Hi there! I'm Hao, a front-end developer based in Toronto, Canada. I'm passionate about web
        development and user experience, and I enjoy building web applications using the latest technology. When
        I'm not coding, my favourite pass times are scouting around small form-factor PC builds, playing video
        games, or hanging out with my friends.
